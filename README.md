- For one of my clients, I had to created a Hexadecimal to decimal converter and then save value to the database. I wasted a lot of time searching online about these numbers. So, I thought uploading a package for the users can be helpful. I used Bignumber.js library to convert bigger numbers.

Hexadecimal to decimal conversion:
```python
var decimal = require('hexadecimal-to-decimal')

console.log(decimal.decimal("10"));
```
